Ever since I decided to pursue programming, creating an RPG has been a long-standing dream—and with this recent project, I’ve taken a significant step toward making it a reality. While the project is far from perfect, I’m excited to continue improving it by implementing additional mechanics like inventory, a shop system, combat, and more complex quests and interactions. This experience was not only incredibly rewarding but also a lot of fun, and throughout the process, I gained valuable knowledge and significantly boosted my confidence as a developer.
