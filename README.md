# Personal-portfolio

Ever since I decided to pursue programming, creating an RPG has been a long-standing dream of mine and with this recent project, I’ve taken a significant step toward making it a reality. While the project is far from perfect, I’m excited to continue improving it by implementing additional mechanics like inventory, a shop system, combat, and more complex quests and interactions. This experience was not only incredibly rewarding but also a lot of fun, I gained valuable knowledge and significantly boosted my confidence as a developer.

Edit 2 :

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been working on Personal Portfolio, focusing on improving the structure and maintainability of my code from my very first project. Here’s a quick breakdown of what I accomplished:



- A new class-based Finite State Machine for NPC behaviors.

- Individual states: Idle, Talk, Fight, Escort

- Shop & inventory system (scalable for multiple NPCs)

- Escort quest with additional dialogue
